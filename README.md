### Description of Each Folder

1. **`cmd/`** : Contains the entry point of the application. The `main.go` file initializes the configuration, loads dependencies, and starts the server.
2. **`configs/`** : Holds the configuration files for the application, such as `config.toml`.
3. **`docs/`** : Stores the generated Swagger documentation files, including JSON, YAML, and the generator logic.
4. **`db/`** : For migrating tables into database.
5. **`internal/`** : Encapsulates the application's internal logic.
   `* data/` : Manages database migrations. Currently supports PostgreSQL, with future dynamic database support planned.
   `* mods/` : Contains the core layers: `dal` (Data Access), `biz` (Business Logic), `api` (API routes and handlers), and `schema` (data models and validation).
   `* server/` : Responsible for creating and starting the server.
   `* routes/` : List All Routes in API.
   `* wirex/` : Handles Google Wire-based dependency injection.
6. **`pkg/`** : A collection of reusable global utilities, such as error handling and utility functions.
7. **`seeder/`** : Seed Data for various purposes in database.
8. **`tests/`** : Contains all testing-related code, separated into unit and integration test directories.
9. **`Makefile`** : Defines build and run commands using `make`.
10. **`README.md`** : Provides a guide for developers working on the project.
